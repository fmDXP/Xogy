# **Xogy**
**Xogy is a Web Browser.**

*Open-Source* Project. (For now)

Xogy Browser is a *small* project, made in python, that's somewhat lightweight (*beta2 is under 200mb*).
Xogy **doesn't require an installation**, and has **cookie managment**.
Xogy uses **between 100mb and 350mb of RAM**, but has not multitasking.

The browser still misses some functions, like downloading, the browser history nor an AdBlocker...
This is my first actual good project, and I hope you will like it.
